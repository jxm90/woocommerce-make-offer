This plugin adds a make offer form in place of the add to cart button, the minimum accept offer is set as price in product settings, and must be enabled under the make offer tab while editting a product.
Plugin settings are in Woocommerce > Make Offer

Needs Fixed: Whenever the minimum offer is accepted, an error message pops up, it doesnt affect functionality but it needs to be fixed.
